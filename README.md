### Goal - Social Media Analytics Dashboard

#### About Problem Statement:
Above repository is a reasearch based assignment or task by [SimPPL](https://simppl.org/). The gist of the problem statemnt was to build a dashboard to present your data analysis after collecting social media data from single or multiple Platforms. The problem statement suggest to recreate a CrowdTangle like dashboard to analysis engagement and growth of social media accounts along with trending post or topic on the platform. The second step was to search or classify information provided on these fringe social media sites as factual or spam.

#### Solution Overview:
Of the provided websites I went with Instagram as it was not attempted before and it would be challenging. The problem statement encompases a lot of thing and is very generalized, so to not get overwhemled by amount of data I decided on a niche. Primarily focusing on the recent event of "Lok Sabha Elections 2024". The Analysis includes dashboards of containing engagement information on major parties, politicians and new channels. To better understand the political scene and relations among the instagram profiles of politicians and parties, I made a network graph of related profiles. During the election period various hashtags were used by these accounts. Made dashboards to visualize the reach for such hashtags, to find the more successful hashtag during the period of election.
